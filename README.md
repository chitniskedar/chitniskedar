# Hi, I'm Kedar Chitnis

Student developer focused on learning by building,  
breaking things intentionally, and understanding systems from the inside.

I enjoy writing code that is simple, readable, and predictable.  
Most of my time goes into strengthening fundamentals, experimenting with ideas,
and improving how I think about problems rather than just solving them.

I’m particularly interested in how precision, speed, and strategy translate
from motorsport into engineering and software design.  
Music stays on in the background — it helps more than most debuggers.
