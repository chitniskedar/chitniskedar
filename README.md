# Kedar Chitnis — on the grid

Student developer approaching software the same way Formula 1 approaches racing:
optimize relentlessly, trust fundamentals, and improve lap by lap.

I care about how systems behave under pressure, how small changes affect outcomes,
and how consistency beats raw speed in the long run.
Most of my work focuses on logic, clarity, and understanding what’s happening
under the hood rather than just chasing results.

Music stays on during long sessions — focus matters as much as technique.

Each tool has a purpose.
Nothing is added without understanding its role.

---

## race strategy

- fundamentals before optimization  
- clarity over clever shortcuts  
- small gains compound over time  
- test, analyze, adjust  

Consistency wins championships.

---

## telemetry (current focus)

- strengthening C / C++ problem-solving  
- writing predictable Python programs  
- improving reasoning and structure  
- building projects with clear intent  

Progress is measured in clarity, not commits.

---

## circuits & experiments

Projects here are treated like race weekends:
design, iteration, review, refinement.

Some are still in testing.
Others are retired after lessons are learned.
All of them contribute to experience.

still learning.  
still refining.  
next lap starts now.
